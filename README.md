# Loan Default Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing loan default risks and providing data-driven insights to minimize defaults in lending. The analysis leverages **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover patterns in loan data, including loan type, credit score, income, and property value, as well as their relationship to default rates.

### Key Features:
- **[Data Overview](https://github.com/DSabarish/loan-default-analysis/blob/main/analysis_NoteBook.ipynb)**: Insights on loan details like loan amount, credit score, and income.
- **[Exploratory Data Analysis](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTroilDO1wBw0hyb_3R6rC3De9qFh1RNBvEf47aRTa8qdim2aQCLwipPs8E6p8mYjP0aJ5c283XDwLD/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=60000)**: Understanding key variables influencing defaults, such as gender, age, and loan amount.
- **[Analysis Notebook](https://github.com/DSabarish/loan-default-analysis/blob/main/analysis_NoteBook.ipynb)**: The full Python analysis and statistical methods used to explore the data.
- **Data**: [Loan Dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DSabarish/loan-default-analysis/refs/heads/main/loan%20(1).csv)

### Recommendations:
- **[LTV Ratio Limits](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTroilDO1wBw0hyb_3R6rC3De9qFh1RNBvEf47aRTa8qdim2aQCLwipPs8E6p8mYjP0aJ5c283XDwLD/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=60000)**: Set Loan-to-Value ratios below 1 to reduce risk.
- **[Income Verification](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTroilDO1wBw0hyb_3R6rC3De9qFh1RNBvEf47aRTa8qdim2aQCLwipPs8E6p8mYjP0aJ5c283XDwLD/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=60000)**: Use Loan-to-Income checks to verify borrowerâ€™s financial stability.

### Conclusion:
A data-driven approach can significantly reduce loan defaults.
